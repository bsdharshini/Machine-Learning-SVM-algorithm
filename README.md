# Machine-Learning-SVM-algorithm.
I have taken a dataset and process it using the SVM algorithm. Libraries pandas and NumPy library is used. We can able to see the output graphically. SVM is a linear classifier. But can be used to perform non-linear classification. SVM is used to build a binary classifier.
